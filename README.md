# lpsimplex

This is a port of the python scipy LP simplex routines. It is intended to be a reasonable implementation for 'real projects;' that is not just for educational purposes.   

## Getting Started

This library has just one main function, LPSimplex(), and two example functions for callback routines. The rest are internal. 

To use this software, copy the repository into your gopath, enter the directory and issue the command 'go install.' This will build and install a copy of the library on your system for your use. 

### Prerequisites

You must have Go installed on your system in order to make use of the library.

## Running the tests

Test development is in progress.

To run the test issue the command: go test
